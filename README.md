# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Isaac

## I am a passionate software developer and hobbyist looking to provide computational solutions to real world problems. At work I am a full stack LAMP developer and Salesforce Admin. For fun, I run a [blog](https://isaacstechblog.com/) I wrote using Python (Flask/SQLITE3) in addition to coding a variety of other "hobby" programs.
